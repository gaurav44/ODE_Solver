# group_BW_ode_solver

The code solves y'(t) = f(y,t) where f(y,t) = -y for sprint1

The procedure for using the code is as follows:

1. The user should input f(y,t) in the function 'f'. 
2. Define dt, t_start, t_end, and initial value y_0
3. compile and run main.cpp
4. In terminal run python3 plot.py to plot the results
